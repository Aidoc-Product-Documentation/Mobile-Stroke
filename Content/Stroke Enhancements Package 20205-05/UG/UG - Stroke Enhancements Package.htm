        <h1>New Stroke-Focused Features</h1>
        <p id="Note">Our new mobile solution enhancements provide rapid data access, highlight potential Stroke patients, support accurate case prioritization, and allow proactive stroke care planning &amp; coordination. </p>
        <p><b><a href="UG - Patient Cards in Mobile Stroke Feed.htm">Stroke Focused Mobile Feed</a>- </b> The expanded mobile feed now includes all potentially relevant patients across supported neuro algorithms, helping ensure no one falls through the cracks.
Patient cards are now created for dedicated stroke imaging as soon as it is identified, so care coordination can begin even earlier.</p>
        <p><a href="UG - Stroke Cases Filter.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">Stroke Cases Filter</a> - A new “Stroke Cases” filter helps your team zero in on urgent stroke-related workflows, tailored to your site’s protocols.</p>
        <p><b><a href="UG - Enhanced Imaging Library.htm">Enhanced Imaging Library</a></b> - Clinicians can now view recent CT and X-ray studies, even if they weren’t analyzed by Aidoc, providing a more complete clinical picture.</p>
        <p><a href="UG - New Mobile Stroke Notifications.htm" style="font-weight: bold;">New Imaging Notifications</a> - New customizable alert for when the first dedicated stroke imaging becomes available—helping you act without delay.</p>
        <p id="Note">All AI results are generated by a BriefCase-Triage medical device</p>
        <h1>Terminology</h1>
        <p><b>Stroke Protocol</b>	- Aidoc’s mobile stroke app can now identify and track Stroke Protocol patients from the moment they are diverted into facility-specific stroke protocol and a stroke imaging study is taken.</p>
        <p><b>Dedicated Stroke Imaging</b>	- Imaging metadata captured by Aidoc indicates imaging was taken under facility stroke protocol.</p>
        <p><b>Non-dedicated Imaging</b> - Imaging metadata captured by Aidoc indicates imaging was taken outside facility stroke protocol.</p>
        <p><b>Incidental Finding</b>	- Suspected stroke finding (VO, BA, ICH) flagged by AI in a non-dedicated (non-stroke protocol) imaging series</p>
        <p><b>Stroke Cases</b>	- Dedicated Stroke imaging AND Non-dedicated CTA imaging flagged with suspected VO findings.</p>
